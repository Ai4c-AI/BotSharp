Please take a look at "Plotting Requirement" and generate a javascript code that can be used to render a chart on a div html element with id {{ chart_element_id }}.

=== Plotting Requirement ===
{{ plotting_requirement }}


*** Important ***
** You must not generate multiple script tags, which means only one <script>...</script> is allowed.
** You must not create any new html element.
** You must output the javascript code only, and wrap it between the script tag.
** You need to import Plotly.js in the same script tag. The script source should be "https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-3.0.1.min.js".
** You need to add the MODE bar for each chart you plot.
** You must not apply any styles on the div html element.
