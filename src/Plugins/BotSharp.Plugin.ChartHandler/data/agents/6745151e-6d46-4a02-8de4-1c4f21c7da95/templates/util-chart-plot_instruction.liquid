Please take a look at "Plotting Requirement" and generate a javascript code that can be used to render the charts on an html element.

=== Plotting Requirement ===
{{ plotting_requirement }}

***** Hard Requirements *****
** Your output must be a single <script>...</script> block with everything needed inside.
** You need to import Plotly.js to plot the charts. The script source should be "https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-3.0.1.min.js".
** You need to add the MODE bar for each chart you plot.
** You must render the charts on the div html element with id {{ chart_element_id }}.
** Add a custom mode bar button named "Fullscreen" that toggles the chart container in and out of fullscreen using the Fullscreen API. Requirements for this button:
    * Always call the Fullscreen API on the chart container div itself (document.getElementById("{{ chart_element_id }}")), not on the document or on Plotlyâ€™s SVG.
    * Use el.requestFullscreen() with fallbacks to el.webkitRequestFullscreen || el.msRequestFullscreen.
    * Exit fullscreen with document.exitFullscreen() and vendor fallbacks.
    * Listen for fullscreenchange, webkitfullscreenchange, and msfullscreenchange to keep the button working across repeated clicks and ESC exits.
    * Ensure the chart fully expands and scales to the entire screen when fullscreen is active.
    * Provide a simple inline SVG path icon for the button (no external assets).
    * Use Plotly.newPlot(container, data, layout, {displayModeBar:true, modeBarButtonsToAdd:[fullscreenBtn]});
    * fullscreenBtn must be a fully-formed object {name, title, icon, click}.
** You must not create any new html element.
** You must not apply any styles on any html element.
** Keep code compact (few tokens), but fix all errors before returning.
** Please fix any code errors before returning the final response.

*** Response Format ***
You must output the response in the following JSON format:
{
    "greeting_message": "A short polite message that informs user that the charts have been generated.",
    "js_code": "The javascript code that can generate the charts as requested."
}
